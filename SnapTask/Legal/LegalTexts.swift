    ## 2. Acceptance & Eligibility

    - EEA/UK: minimum age 16 unless parental consent is provided.

    ## 3. The App and Your Account
    The App can work without creating a traditional account. Some features may create an anonymous identifier on your device. If you enable iCloud CloudKit sync, your data is associated with your Apple ID in your private iCloud database. You are responsible for device security.

    ## 4. License and Restrictions
    - License: a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to install and use the App on Apple-branded devices you own or control, per the App Store Terms.
    - You may not:
      - copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the App;
      - reverse engineer or attempt to extract source code unless permitted by law;
      - use the App unlawfully or infringe others’ rights (privacy, IP, publicity);
      - interfere with or disrupt the App’s operation.

    ## 5. User Content
    You are responsible for content you store in the App (tasks, notes, photos, voice memos). You represent you have rights to it and it does not violate laws or third-party rights.
    Where features require processing (e.g., feedback via Firebase), you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, and process such content to operate and improve the App.

    ## 6. Purchases, Subscriptions, Trials
    - Purchases and subscriptions are processed by Apple. We do not collect or store full payment card data.
    - Auto-renew: subscriptions renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before period end; Apple charges within 24 hours prior to renewal.
    - Manage/Cancel: in your App Store account settings. Deleting the App does not cancel subscriptions.
    - Pricing changes: we may change prices/terms; if required, advance notice will be provided. If you disagree, cancel before renewal.
    - Free trials (if offered): convert to paid unless canceled before trial ends. Trial eligibility is determined by Apple.
    - Refunds: handled by Apple per App Store policies.

    ## 7. Privacy
    Your use of the App is subject to our Privacy Policy.

    ## 8. Third-Party Services
    The App may rely on:
    - Apple iCloud CloudKit (sync to your private iCloud),
    - Apple StoreKit (purchases/subscriptions),
    - Google Firebase / Firestore (feedback, limited internal analytics),
    - Apple/Google Calendars (if you connect calendar features).
    Their terms and privacy policies apply.

    ## 9. Account/Data Deletion
    - You can request deletion of data we control (e.g., Firebase feedback) by email; we’ll verify and delete where legally permitted.
    - CloudKit data is stored in your private iCloud tied to your Apple ID. You manage/delete it in iOS/iCloud settings; we cannot access or delete it on your behalf.
    - Cancel subscriptions in App Store settings; data/account deletion does not cancel subscriptions.

    ## 10. Intellectual Property
    The App (excluding your content) is owned by us/licensors and protected by IP laws. Feedback you provide may be used by us without restriction.

    ## 11. Disclaimers
    The App is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind (express, implied, statutory), including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not warrant uninterrupted, error-free, or secure operation.

    ## 12. Limitation of Liability
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages; or loss of profits, data, or goodwill.
    Our aggregate liability shall not exceed the greater of: (a) amounts you paid (if any) in the 12 months prior to the event; or (b) USD 100. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; those may not apply to you.

    ## 13. Indemnification
    You will indemnify and hold us harmless from claims, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your use of the App or violation of these Terms.

    ## 14. Export/Sanctions Compliance
    You are not subject to restricted sanctions and will comply with applicable export/sanctions laws.

    ## 15. Changes and Termination
    We may modify or discontinue the App at any time. We may update these Terms; material changes will be notified in-App or by reasonable means. Continued use after changes take effect means acceptance.
    We may suspend/terminate access for violations. Sections that should survive do so (IP, disclaimers, liability limits, indemnity, governing law).

    ## 16. Governing Law and Venue
    These Terms are governed by the laws of Italy. Exclusive venue: Bologna, Italy, except where mandatory consumer laws provide otherwise.

    ## 17. Apple App Store; Third-Party Beneficiary
    These Terms are between you and us, not Apple. Apple has no maintenance or support obligation. In case of non-conformity, you may notify Apple for a refund (if any). Apple is a third-party beneficiary and may enforce these Terms.
